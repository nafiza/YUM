            <p>Welcome to <em>Yummy things with Nafiza!</em>
            The purpose of this one-pager is to show you various ways to use simple
            ingredients to enhance your food/meals! I'll try to keep the ingredients
            minimal for all the delightful things we'll make!

            I think the special ingredients will be:
            Chocolate & Strawberries
            <img src="" alt="Godiva chocolate bar squares"> <img src="" alt="A cute little red strawberry">

            Our aim is to make the following:</p>
            <a href="#Breakfast">Breakfast</a>: Pancakes with chocolate bits, topped with strawberry sauce
                tips: |.| add frozen yogurt or ice cream on top,
                      |.| make waffles instead; they are crispier than pancakes and
                          can hold more sauce/ice-cream!
            Lunch: Truffle sandwich -- literally just: Bread. Truffle. Toast. Eat.
                tip: add sliced banana and strawberries to add flavor/texture
            Dinner: Godiva liquor infused and chocolate covered strawberries,
                      with a salty/spicy strawberry chili salad
                tip: take the liquor infused strawberry and do chocolate coating
            </p>
