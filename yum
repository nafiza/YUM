            <p>Welcome to <em>Yummy things with Nafiza!</em>
            The purpose of this one-pager is to show you various ways to use simple
            ingredients to enhance your food/meals! I'll try to keep the ingredients
            minimal for all the delightful things we'll make!

            I think the special ingredients will be:
            Chocolate & Strawberries
            <img src="" alt="Godiva chocolate bar squares"> <img src="" alt="A cute little red strawberry">

            Our aim is to make the following:</p>
            <a href="#Breakfast">Breakfast</a>: Pancakes with chocolate bits, topped with strawberry sauce
                tips: |.| add frozen yogurt or ice cream on top,
                      |.| make waffles instead; they are crispier than pancakes and
                          can hold more sauce/ice-cream!
            Lunch: Truffle sandwich -- literally just: Bread. Truffle. Toast. Eat.
                tip: add sliced banana and strawberries to add flavor/texture
            Dinner: Godiva liquor infused and chocolate covered strawberries,
                      with a salty/spicy strawberry chili salad
                tip: take the liquor infused strawberry and do chocolate coating
            </p>

            <ul><h3>Ingredients:<h3>
            <li>Pancake Mix (Aunt Jemima's) or make your own batter!</li>
            <li>Washed and stemmed strawberries</li>
            <li>Brown Sugar</li>
            <li> Butter or vegetable oil for frying</li>
            <li>Truffles, or cubes of chocolate, cut into chunks</li>
            </ul>
            <ol>
            <h3>Directions:<h3>
            <li><p>Use mix as instructed to make a batter; usually you combine the dry 
            mix in water and/or egg. For every cup of pancake mix, add 3tbs of brown
            sugar. <em>Do not</en> use pancake mix for waffles!</p></li>
            <li> Add chunks or cubes of chocolate into the pancake mix/batter</li>
            <li> Mix until chocolate is dispersed and batter is not too thick</li>
            <li><p>On a skillet, heat butter or oil on medium heat. Then pour or
            use a ladle to add mixture into skillet in the size/shape you desire.</li>
            <li>While pancakes are cooking, mash or puree (in a blender) strawberries</li>
            <li>If you wish, add a sweetner to strawberry puree and mix thoroughly</li>
            <li>Flip pancake once it has reached desired color</li>
            <li><p>Once both sides of pancake are cooked, plate the pancakes with the
            strawberry puree on top. If you wish, you can have it with a side of ice
            cream or frozen yogurt! Preferrably Cold Stone strawberry ice cream with
            Graham cracker pie crust. Just kidding, you can choose whatever you want!</p></li>
