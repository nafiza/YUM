            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>Welcome to <em>Yummy things with Nafiza!</em>
            The purpose of this one-pager is to show you various ways to use simple
            ingredients to enhance your food/meals! I'll try to keep the ingredients
            minimal for all the delightful things we'll make!

            I think the special ingredients will be:
            Chocolate & Strawberries
            <img src="" alt="Godiva chocolate bar squares"> <img src="" alt="A cute little red strawberry">

            Our aim is to make the following:</p>
            <a href="#Breakfast">Breakfast</a>: Pancakes with chocolate bits, topped with strawberry sauce
                tips: |.| add frozen yogurt or ice cream on top,
                      |.| make waffles instead; they are crispier than pancakes and
                          can hold more sauce/ice-cream!
            <a href="Lunch">Lunch</a>: Truffle sandwich -- literally just: Bread. Truffle. Toast. Eat.
                tip: add sliced banana and strawberries to add flavor/texture
            <a href="Dinner">Dinner</a>: Godiva liquor infused and chocolate covered strawberries,
                      with a salty/spicy strawberry chili salad
                tip: take the liquor infused strawberry and do chocolate coating

            <h3>Pancakes with Chocolate Bits and Strawberry Puree</h3>
            <h4>Ingredients:<h4>
            <ul>
            <li>Pancake Mix (Aunt Jemima's) or make your own batter!</li>
            <li>Washed and stemmed strawberries</li>
            <li>Brown Sugar</li>
            <li>Butter or vegetable oil for frying</li>
            <li>Truffles, or cubes of chocolate, cut into chunks</li>
            <li><p><strong>Notes:</strong> The portions you use may/will vary depending on how
            many you are trying to serve (and how much you can eat). For every two  
            people, I'd recommend: 1 cup of mix, dozen strawberries, half cup of
            sugar, 2 table spoons of oil max, and 6 truffles. You should vary this
            depending on how sweet or unsweet you like you pancakes.</p>
            </ul>
            <ol>
            <h4>Directions:<h4>
            <li><p>Use mix as instructed to make a batter; usually you combine the dry 
            mix in water and/or egg. For every cup of pancake mix, add 3tbs of brown
            sugar. <em>Do not</en> use pancake mix for waffles!</p></li>
            <li> Add chunks or cubes of chocolate into the pancake mix/batter</li>
            <li> Mix until chocolate is dispersed and batter is not too thick</li>
            <li><p>On a skillet, heat butter or oil on medium heat. Then pour or
            use a ladle to add mixture into skillet in the size/shape you desire.</li>
            <li>While pancakes are cooking, mash or puree (in a blender) strawberries</li>
            <li>If you wish, add a sweetner to strawberry puree and mix thoroughly</li>
            <li>Flip pancake once it has reached desired color</li>
            <li><p>Once both sides of pancake are cooked, plate the pancakes with the
            strawberry puree on top. If you wish, you can have it with a side of ice
            cream or frozen yogurt! Preferrably Cold Stone strawberry ice cream with
            Graham cracker pie crust. Just kidding, you can choose whatever you want!</p></li>

        <h3>Truffle Toast</h3>
        <h4>Ingredients:<h4>
        <ul>
        <li>Bread, sliced (I like to use Italian, French or Multigrain)</li>
        <li>Truffles or chocolate bar cubes</li>
        <li><p><strong>Notes</strong>: Use as many slices of bread, and pieces of chocolate as you want!
        I usually use 2 truffles or 1 chocolate cube per peice of bread, and fold
        that in half to make a sandwhich/smush the melted chocolate!</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Directions - Toaster Oven Method:</h4>
        <ol>
        <li>Place bread slice in toaster oven, with 2 truffles sitting on the bread</li>
        <li><p>Turn toaster oven on medium heat (nothing to high because it'll 
        dry out the chocolate)<p></li>
        <li><p>When toasting is complete, remove bread slice with softentened 
        chocolate, and either use a knife to spread the chocolate, or fold bread
        in half to smush it</p></li
        <li><p><strong>Notes</strong>: If you do fold the bread in half, be careful if the bread has
        holes, because the warm melted chocolate will seep through! (Yum!)
        If you are adding sliced strawberries and bananas, I'd add them after
        they've already been removed from the toaster, as I hate soggy/cooked
        fruit and it stays put once the chocolate is all melty.</p></li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Directions - Pan Method:</h4>
        <ol>
        <li>On a medium skillet, heat a spoonful of butter, or oil</li>
        <li>Toast both sides until it begins to brown</li>
        <li><p>Place 2 truffles on one slice of bread, not too close to one another 
        or the edge of the bread.<li>
        <li><p>When truffle begins to melt, place other slice of bread on top of truffles
        and press down gently with your fingers (caution: hot) or a spatchula</p><li>
        <li><p>Remove from Pan when the chocolate is dispersed and the pieces of
        bread sit nicely on top of one another</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Notes</strong>: If you are adding fruit, do it between step 3 and step 4.
        You'll have to spread the softened truffles, then add fruit, then place the
        second piece of bread on top of it. OR, you can finish step 4, remove
        the top piece of bread (if you put it back on the pan, make sure the chocolate
        side is up!), then add fruit (distribute evenly), then place the bread on 
        top again (chocolate side down/directly on fruit). Then smush/spatchula/etc.</p></li>
