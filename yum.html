            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to <em>Yummy things with Nafiza!</em></p>
            <p>The purpose of this one-pager is to show you various ways to use simple
            ingredients to enhance your food/meals! I'll try to keep the ingredients
            minimal for all the delightful things we'll make! I do have to warn you though, I am not 
            someone who can tell you how to portion your ingredients; I portion everything by eye 
            and for small serving, and I think you should really portion your ingredients depending 
            on how sweet you like your food or how much of a &quot;guilty pleasure&quot; this meal will be. </p>
            <p>I think the special ingredients will be:</p>

            <h3>Our aim is to make the following:</h3>
            <p><a href="#Breakfast"><strong>Breakfast</strong></a>: Pancakes with chocolate bits, topped with strawberry sauce</p>
                <p><em>tip:</em> |.| add frozen yogurt or ice cream on top,</p>
                <p><em>tip:</em> |.| make waffles instead; they are crispier than pancakes and
                          can hold more sauce/ice-cream!</p>
            <p><a href="#Lunch"><strong>Lunch</strong></a>: Truffle sandwich -- literally just: Bread. Truffle. Toast. Eat.
                <p><em>tip:</em> |.| add sliced banana and strawberries to add flavor/texture</p>

                      with a salty/spicy strawberry chili salad</p>

            <h1>Breakfast</h1>
            <h2>Pancakes with Chocolate Bits and Strawberry Puree</h2>
			<img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2862/12424701035_7e9f025b71_n.jpg" class="dishes"
			alt="Pancakes, stacked">
            <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pancake Mix (Aunt Jemima's) or make your own batter!</li>
                    <li>Washed and stemmed strawberries</li>
                    <li>Brown Sugar</li>
                    <li>Butter or vegetable oil for frying</li>
                    <li>Truffles, or cubes of chocolate, cut into chunks</li>
                    <li><strong>Portioning Notes</strong>: The portions you use may/will vary depending on how
                    many you are trying to serve (and how much you can eat). For every two
                    people, I'd recommend: 1 cup of mix, dozen strawberries, half cup of
                    sugar, 2 table spoons of oil max, and 6 truffles. You should vary this
                    depending on how sweet or unsweet you like you pancakes.</li>
                    <li><strong>General Notes</strong>: If you want to spice up your pancake, and give it
                    more dynamic, you can add a half a teaspoon - a teaspoon of vanilla
                    extract and a bit of cinnamon into the batter. I like to taste the raw
                    cinnamon powder to get a sense of its strength before putting it in.
                    If you have raw cinnamon sticks that you are grounding, I usually
                    ground half the portion because that tends to be a little stronger.</li>
                </ul>
            <h4>Directions:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Use mix as instructed to make a batter; usually you combine the dry
                    mix in water and/or egg. For every cup of pancake mix, add 3tbs of brown
                    sugar. <em>Do not</em> use pancake mix for waffles!</li>
                    <li> Add chunks or cubes of chocolate into the pancake mix/batter</li>
                    <li> Mix until chocolate is dispersed and batter is not too thick</li>
                    <li>On a skillet, heat butter or oil on medium heat. Then pour or
                    use a ladle to add mixture into skillet in the size/shape you desire.</li>
                    <li>While pancakes are cooking, mash or puree (in a blender) strawberries</li>
                    <li>If you wish, add a sweetener to strawberry puree and mix thoroughly</li>
                    <li>Flip pancake once it has reached desired color</li>
                    <li>Once both sides of pancake are cooked, plate the pancakes with the
                    strawberry puree on top. If you wish, you can have it with a side of ice
                    cream or frozen yogurt! Preferably Cold Stone strawberry ice cream with
                    Graham cracker pie crust. Just kidding, you can choose whatever you want!</li>

            <h1>Lunch</h1>
            <h2>Truffle Toast</h2>
			<img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3692/12424775345_daa3fe9d17_n.jpg" class="dishes"
			alt="truffle toast">
            <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Bread, sliced (I like to use Italian, French or Multigrain)</li>
                    <li>Truffles or chocolate bar cubes</li>
                    <li><strong>Notes</strong>: Use as many slices of bread, and pieces of chocolate as you want!
                    I usually use 2 truffles or 1 chocolate cube per piece of bread, and fold
                    that in half to make a sandwhich/smush the melted chocolate!</li>
                </ul>
            <h4>Directions - Toaster Oven Method:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Place bread slice in toaster oven, with 2 truffles sitting on the bread</li>
                    <li>Turn toaster oven on medium heat (nothing to high because it'll
                    dry out the chocolate)</li>
                    <li>When toasting is complete, remove bread slice with softened
                    chocolate, and either use a knife to spread the chocolate, or fold bread
                    in half to smush it</li>
                    <li><strong>Notes</strong>: If you do fold the bread in half, be careful if the bread has
                    holes, because the warm melted chocolate will seep through! (Yum!)
                    If you are adding sliced strawberries and bananas, I'd add them after
                    they've already been removed from the toaster, as I hate soggy/cooked
                    fruit and it stays put once the chocolate is all melty.</li>
                </ol>
            <h4>Directions - Pan Method:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>On a medium skillet, heat a spoonful of butter, or oil</li>
                    <li>Toast both sides until it begins to brown</li>
                    <li>Place 2 truffles on one slice of bread, not too close to one another
                    or the edge of the bread.</li>
                    <li>When truffle begins to melt, place other slice of bread on top of truffles
                    and press down gently with your fingers (caution: hot) or a spatula</li>
                    <li>Remove from Pan when the chocolate is dispersed and the pieces of
                    bread sit nicely on top of one another</li>
                    <li><strong>Notes</strong>: If you are adding fruit, do it between step 3 and step 4.
                    You'll have to spread the softened truffles, then add fruit, then place the
                    second piece of bread on top of it. OR, you can finish step 4, remove
                    the top piece of bread (if you put it back on the pan, make sure the chocolate
                    side is up!), then add fruit (distribute evenly), then place the bread on
                    top again (chocolate side down/directly on fruit). Then smush/spatchula/etc.</li>
                </ol>

        <h2>Chocolate Covered Liquored Strawberries</h2>
        <img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2881/12424787025_c4a5c48644_n.jpg" class="dishes"
			alt="Strawberry">
		<h4>Ingredients:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Strawberries, washed, stemmed (keep the step for holding, if you want)</li>
                <li>Godiva Chocolate Liquor</li>
                <li>Chocolate truffles or chocolate bar cubes</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Directions:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Fill food-injection-thingy with the Godiva chocolate liquor</li>
                <li>Inject strawberries with desired amount (don't overdo it though)</li>
                <li>Leave injected strawberries overnight in the fridge, or for a few hours</li>
                <li><strong>Notes:</strong> If you are injecting the strawberry from the bottom, leave 
                the bottom side up so the liquor does not just seap out. Be careful when injecting, 
                and be prepared to have some of it splash out. Keep a cup on the side filled with liquor 
                (in case you need to taste it to ensure it's right for your strawberries, of course.)</li>
                <li>When strawberries have chilled, leave out for half an hour, then
                begin to melt the chocolate. You can melt the chocolate/truffles in a pan
                OR... take a candle oil burner and melt chocolates on small ceramic plate
                that can sit on top of the candle burner (do not melt chocolate in the
                same thing you burn oils on, that's a no-no). Place truffles onto plate
                and watch carefully as it begins to melt/soften.</li>
                <li>When chocolate has melted, drip strawberries into chocolate,
                remove from the chocolate and let the air harden the chocolate that
                molded onto the strawberry, then dip again to cover the rest. Repeat
                process until strawberry is covered in chocolate</li>
                <li><strong>Notes:</strong> <em>Do not</em> leave the strawberries chilled for too long!
                the liquor begins to taste like nail polish remover! Also, if you do not want 
                to infuse the strawberries with the liquor, you can just skip right to coating
                it in chocolate.
                <li><strong>Notes:</strong> You can also watch this video to see how the
                strawberries are coated in chocolate using this method:</li>

			alt="Spicy Strawberry Salad">
        <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Salt (any kind, fine works best though)</li>
                <li>Chili peppers</li>
                <li>Strawberries, washed, stemmed, and thinly sliced</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Directions:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Cut up chili peppers, then smash so that the juices have come out</li>
                <li>Take a pinch of salt for every handful of strawberries, rub gently
                onto the strawberry slices</li>
                <li>Mix chili peppers into salted strawberry mix</li>
                <li><strong>Notes</strong>: If you happen to have some fresh mint or cilantro,
                you can finely chop it up and add it to the mix to add flavor. If you
                add these, make sure to wash thoroughly before chopping!</li>
